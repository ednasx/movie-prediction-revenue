Problem Definition
Are we able to predict the revenue for a a given movie?
Models Used
uni-variate Regression
Multi-variate Regression
Random forest Regression

Conclusion
Vote_count and budget have high correlation scores with revenue
Multi-variate regression using categorical variables does not perform well due to the low R2 value 
Random forest regression does perform well using both numerical and categorical 
Yes, it is possible to predict a movie's revenue if given the correct model to predict
The best model is the Random Forest model provides a robust framework for predicting movie revenue with high accuracy and flexibility.

What did we learn from this project?
Handling incomplete dataset 
How to combine both numerical and categorical variables into a regression model by one-hot encoding the categorical variables and then by using a random forest regression.
RandomForestRegressor from sklearn
